# AFrameTestStuff

The current test file just has a component that lets you place a block of some color wherever your cursor is pointing when you click. Note that the cursor position is based on the camera's gaze and not the player's mouse. Default camera controls are used, so WASD to move + click/drag to rotate the camera. On mobile, you can tilt the device to look around and tapping should function as clicking.
